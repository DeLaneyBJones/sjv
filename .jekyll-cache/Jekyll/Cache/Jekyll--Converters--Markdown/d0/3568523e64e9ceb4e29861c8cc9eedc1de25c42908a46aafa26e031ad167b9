I"Ù<p>â€œThe Muppet Show Themeâ€ (written by Henson and Sam Pottle in 1976[7]) is the showâ€™s theme song.</p>

<p>At the end of the song, Gonzo the Great appeared onstage to play the final note, with various comical results. Each episode ended with an extended instrumental performance of â€œThe Muppet Show Themeâ€ by the Muppet orchestra before Statler and Waldorf gave the last laugh of the night. Some last laugh sequences featured other Muppets on the balcony. For example, in one episode, the Muppets of Sesame Street appeared behind the duo who told them: â€œHow should we know how to get to Sesame Street? We donâ€™t even know how to get out of this stupid theater box!â€</p>

<p>Every season, the TV version of the song was presented with re-worked lyrics. While the opening sequence evolved visually over the course of the showâ€™s five seasons, the musical composition remained essentially the same. Throughout the years, the song has become a staple of the franchise.</p>
